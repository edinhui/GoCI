# Configuration Management Component Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a configuration management component designed for Golang applications. The component provides a comprehensive solution for managing JSON-based configurations through a user-friendly interface and programmatic APIs.

## Purpose

The configuration management component aims to simplify the process of creating, viewing, and modifying configuration files for Golang applications. It provides a structured approach to configuration management through JSON Schema definitions and offers both frontend interfaces and backend APIs for seamless integration.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Golang
- **Frontend**: Vue 3
- **Data Storage**: JSON files
- **Configuration Format**: JSON
- **Schema Definition**: JSON Schema
- **API Design**: RESTful

## Functional Requirements

### 1. JSON Schema Creation Interface
The JSON Schema creation interface allows users to define the structure and validation rules for their configuration files. It provides a visual editor that enables users to create and edit JSON Schema definitions. The interface supports defining up to 3 levels of configuration hierarchy, including navigation, sidebar, and page levels. Users can specify data types, default values, and validation constraints for each configuration item. The interface also includes a preview functionality to visualize the generated schema.

#### 1.1 Features

- A web-based interface for creating JSON Schema definitions
- Visual editor for defining configuration structure and validation rules
- Support for defining up to 3 levels of configuration hierarchy
- Ability to specify data types, default values, and validation constraints
- Preview functionality for the generated schema
- Integration with JSON Schema validation libraries for schema validation
- provide **[vue-json-schema-editor-visual](https://github.com/zyqwst/json-schema-editor-vue3)** like UI interface for creating JSON Schema definitions
#### 1.2 Outputs

- JSON Schema file that defines the structure and validation rules for configuration files
- Default JSON configuration file based on the defined schema with pre-populated default values
- Generated code snippets for accessing configuration values in Golang applications

### 2. Configuration Viewing and Editing Interface
The configuration viewing and editing interface provides a completely form-based user experience for working with configuration files. The interface:

- Dynamically generates forms based on JSON Schema definitions
- Provides appropriate input controls for each configuration field type
- Supports hierarchical navigation through configuration levels
- Offers real-time validation and error highlighting
- Maintains version history of all changes

#### 2.1 Features
- Schema-driven form generation (no raw JSON editing)
- Field-specific input controls (dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.)
- Grouping and categorization of related settings
- Real-time validation feedback
- Change tracking and version comparison
- Bulk editing for array-type configurations

#### 2.2 User Experience
- Intuitive form-based workflow
- Visual grouping of related settings
- Inline help and documentation
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Save/Reset/Cancel controls
- Audit trail of changes

### 3. Backend API for Configuration Access

#### 3.1 Configuration Retrieval

- API endpoint for retrieving entire configuration files
- Support for retrieving specific configuration values using JSONPath expressions
- Caching mechanisms for improved performance
- Support for environment-specific configuration overrides

#### 3.2 Configuration Persistence

- API endpoint for saving modified configuration files
- Validation of submitted configurations against JSON Schema
- Backup of previous configuration versions before saving changes
- Atomic write operations to prevent configuration corruption

### 4. Configuration Structure

#### 4.1 Hierarchy Levels

- Each JSON configuration file provides a major category of configuration, containing up to 3 levels:
  - **Level 1 (Navigation Bar Level)**: Configuration items displayed in the top navigation bar
  - **Level 2 (Sidebar Level)**: Configuration categories displayed in the sidebar
  - **Level 3 (Page Level)**: Detailed configuration items displayed in the configuration page

#### 4.2 File Organization

- JSON Schema files are stored in a dedicated directory
- JSON configuration files are stored in another dedicated directory
- Each JSON Schema and its corresponding JSON configuration has its own separate directory
- Directory names match the JSON Schema names
- Clear file naming conventions
- Metadata for tracking configuration versions and modification timestamps

### 5. Integration with Golang Applications

#### 5.1 Library Interface

- Simple API for initializing the configuration system
- Functions for accessing configuration values by path
- Support for type-safe configuration access
- Event hooks for configuration changes
- Hot reloading capability for configuration updates

#### 5.2 Error Handling

- Clear error messages for configuration access issues
- Fallback mechanisms for missing configuration values
- Logging of configuration access patterns for debugging

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- Fast loading and parsing of configuration files
- Efficient access to configuration values
- Minimal memory footprint

### 2. Security

- Protection against unauthorized configuration access
- Validation of user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Optional encryption for sensitive configuration values

### 3. Reliability

- Robust error handling for malformed configuration files
- Automatic recovery from corrupted configurations
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Scalability

- Support for large configuration files
- Efficient handling of multiple concurrent configuration access requests
- Modular design for extending functionality

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Frontend Implementation

- Component-based architecture using Vue 3
- Reactive form handling for real-time validation
- State management for complex configuration editing
- Responsive design for various device sizes

### 2. Backend Implementation

- RESTful API design for configuration access
- Efficient JSON parsing and manipulation
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed configurations
- Concurrent access handling

### 3. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for configuration access functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for configuration workflows
- Performance benchmarks for configuration operations

## Deployment and Distribution

- Packaging as a reusable Golang library
- Documentation for integration with existing applications
- Example applications demonstrating usage patterns
- Versioning strategy for backward compatibility

## Future Enhancements

- Support for distributed configuration across multiple services
- Integration with external configuration sources (e.g., environment variables, key-value stores)
- Advanced validation rules and custom validators
- Configuration templates for common application types
